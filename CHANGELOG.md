## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Removed the borders from the main elements to give it a more subtle and smooth feel to the colorscheme in general
- Made the colors on the file tab match the color of the editor for a more unified feel
- Minor changes on the accent colors for the side bar badges and the remote control on the status bar to make it more minimalist and subtle
